Both test_scraper and scraped_by_chatgpt scraped data from the site https://books.toscrape.com/, which is a site to practice web scraping. 
I simply made my own script first before trying to generate one using chatgpt. I only made minor modifications on chatgpt's code.

The data I scraped are:
- The books's name
- The book's price
- The book's stock
- The book's description

Then I wrote them to a csv file.
I'm still a beginner and yet to scrape dynamic content

The selenium_scraper is where I practice web scraping using selenium because contnents of a site could be dynamic.
My code is still beginner and it still needs improvement. I just want to upload what I've accomplished so far.
